ex.4

- Our local department store closed down because online stores **undercut** their prices and the **board** didn’t invest enough.
- One huge company controls both production and distribution. Basically, it’s a **monopoly** in this country. A lot of people would like it to be **broken up**.
- The restaurant’s **struggling** because of a mixture of rising costs and poor financial **management**. Apparently, they redecorated when they didn’t need to.
- With the boom in technology, they’ve expanded very rapidly. They’ve doubled their **turnover** in the last year and the company’s **valued** at 30 million dollars now.
- It’s taken advantage of a new trend and its business is booming. I’m not sure how **sustainable** it is though unless they **branch out** into other areas.
- They were doing well, but I think they lost **focus** and allowed their competitors to get an **edge** over them.
