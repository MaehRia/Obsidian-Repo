When studying in TumoLabs, I was given a study material, which I should've completed within 12 months. 

**Started :** 28 Jun, 2024 (Fri)
**Ended :** Not yet

So, here is training material:

[[Python_Intro]]:

1st station:
1. [Python Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?si=S_8KPJxU1JtTDH3P) 
Notes from this video course are taken in [[Python Course for Beginners + ML]] note.

3. https://www.py4e.com/
Stopping at Lesson 12 is perfect for the learning outcomes youâ€™ll need before moving on to more advanced Python language skills.
At this level, Lesson 8 is unnecessary as it will be covered later in Learning Station 2. If you want to get a head start on the next learning station, though, feel free to check out Lesson 8.
