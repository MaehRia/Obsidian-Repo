What are naming conventions?

As a programmer, you’ve got to name a lot of things, like variables, functions, classes, and methods. Reliability is important, so naming conventions are an agreed upon way of naming these things the same way each time. This improves the readability of your code, which is vital when you’re working in a team.

There are a lot of naming conventions, so here are the most popular: (==Pascal Naming Convention== is 9th case in this list)
