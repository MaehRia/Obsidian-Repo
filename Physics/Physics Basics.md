Vector:
- magnitude/ size
- direction
	ex. displacement, velocity( V = S/T)
Scalars:
- magnitude/ size
	ex. distance

# Displacement

An object's **position** is its location relative to a chosen ==reference frame==. Position is a vector with both magnitude and direction. The variable $\overrightarrow{x}$ is often used to represent horizontal position. The variable $\overrightarrow{y}$ is often used to represent vertical position.

If an object moves relative to its reference frame, then the object’s position changes. This change in position is known as ==displacement.

Displacement is defined mathematically as:

1. $\Delta$ $\overrightarrow{x}$ = $\overrightarrow{x}$ - $\overrightarrow{x}_0$   

  $\Delta$ $\overrightarrow{x}$ -> displacement
  $\overrightarrow{x}$ -> the final (or current) position the initial position
  $\overrightarrow{x}_0$ -> the initial position
  
This equation says that displacement is the change in an object's position, or equivalently, the difference between the object's final position and initial position.

Since position is a vector, displacement is also a **vector** with both magnitude and direction. When working in one dimension, the sign (+/-) of position and displacement describe their direction. So, we can simplify our equation by removing the vector notation, while carefully remembering that these _are_ vector quantities:

$\Delta$${x}$ = ${x}$ - ${x}_0$

His displacement is negative because his motion is toward the rear of the plane, which is the negative direction in our chosen coordinate system.

When an object moves, there are two different ways we can describe "how far" it moved. One way is by calculating its displacement, which is its change in position (a vector). Another way is by calculating the **distance** travelled, which is the total path length (a scalar). At first, these two quantities may sound like the same thing. But they are NOT the same.

# Velocity(արագություն)

$$\overrightarrow{v} = \frac{\overrightarrow{S}}{t}$$
   $\overrightarrow{S}$  -> displacement


$$
v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x_f - x_0}{t_f - t_0}
$$
   $x_f$ -> final position
   $x_0$ -> starting position

A large displacement in a small amount of time means a large velocity and that velocity has units of distance divided by time,
such as miles per hour or kilometers per hour.

# Rate of speed(արագացում)

$$r = \frac{d}{t} $$
   d -> distance

# Instantaneous speed

Instantaneous speed is a speed of an object at a particular moment in time.

$$
V_{instantaneous} = lim_{h \to 0}\frac{x(t + h) - x(t)}{h}
$$
$$
V_{instantaneous} = \frac{dx}{dt}
$$
